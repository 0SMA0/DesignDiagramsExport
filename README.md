# DesignDiagramsExport

## Description
This repository is used to developing an application to generate diagrams from a folder structure, visualizing file connections using Python and integrating Draw.io directly from the code files they write.

## Future
Integrate generative AI to enhance the application of design patterns, making system architecture more intuitive for developers. 
Enhance interactivity so that manipulating the diagram can update the code, and vice versa.
